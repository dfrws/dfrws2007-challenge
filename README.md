# dfrws2007-challenge
The DFRWS 2007 Challenge an international competition to advance the state-of-the-art of data carving, which is a file recovery technique that is frequently used during digital investigations. Files are "carved" from the unallocated space using file type-specific information, such as footers, headers, and internal structures.

The results of existing file carving tools typically contain many false positives and fail to recover some files. An investigator must test each of the extracted files by opening them in an application that supports the file type. The DFRWS 2007 Challenge introduced more file types and more complex fragmentation scenarios. 

The goal of this challenge is to design and develop automated file carving algorithms that identify more files and reduce the number of false positives.
